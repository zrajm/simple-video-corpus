Simple Video Corpus
===================
This is a simple video corpus created for my friend Nik at the office of the
[Swedish Sign Language Lexicon].

It is inspired by the [Swedish Sign Language Corpus] that was built by myself
and Patrick Hansson, but this version is far simpler and more experimental. It
features vertically scrolling annotations (similar to movie end credits), and
very few dependencies.
